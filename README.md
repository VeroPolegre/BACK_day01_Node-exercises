## Routing with Node.js

Create HTML code to serve a classic web page (Home | Who we are? | Where we are? | What we do? | Contact... etc...)

Now the response to the request of each route (endpoint) is the corresponding HTML files: home.html, contact.html, about.html...

Make the necessary modifications so that our script runs with npm start.

| Node.js | HTML | JS|
